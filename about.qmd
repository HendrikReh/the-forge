The e-commerce architectures I built in 2015 weren’t designed for the agent-driven, tool-using AI systems we’re building in 2025. Instead of patching outdated patterns, I’m spending five months (June - October) in full-time upskilling mode - taking ten masterclasses on AI engineering, evaluation, security, and large-scale model training.

This series shares what I learn along the way: real-world takeaways, working patterns, and the occasional hard lesson - one course at a time.
