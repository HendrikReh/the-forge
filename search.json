Instead of patching outdated patterns, I’m spending five months (June - October) in full-time upskilling mode - taking ten masterclasses on AI engineering, evaluation, security, and large-scale model training.\nThis series shares what I learn along the way: real-world takeaways, working patterns, and the occasional hard lesson - one course at a time."
